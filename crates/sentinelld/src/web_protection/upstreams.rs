//! Discovering the machine's real DNS servers.
//!
//! `upstreams = ["system"]` means "whatever the active adapters are
//! configured to use". There is no registry location that answers this
//! correctly across DHCP, VPN tunnels and per-interface overrides —
//! `GetAdaptersAddresses` is the supported way, and it is what the DNS
//! Client itself resolves against.
//!
//! # The filter that matters
//!
//! A DNS server entry pointing at OUR OWN listener is an infinite loop:
//! one client query becomes an in-flight query to ourselves, which becomes
//! another, until the in-flight pool is saturated and every query on the
//! machine SERVFAILs. Measured on the crate under test: with
//! `max_in_flight = 64`, ONE client query produced 65 internal queries in
//! 26 ms.
//!
//! This is not a theoretical shape. `127.0.0.1` is the normal adapter DNS
//! on any machine that has ever run dnscrypt-proxy, Acrylic, a local
//! Pi-hole, or a previous install of this product. So loopback entries are
//! dropped, and if that leaves nothing we report NO upstreams rather than
//! inventing one — the design forbids a hardcoded public resolver, and a
//! resolver silently pointed somewhere the operator did not choose is
//! worse than a resolver that refuses to start.
//!
//! Dropped ENTRY BY ENTRY, by the same test `dnsguard` applies at bind
//! (see `is_self_referential`). The two halves of one safety rule have to
//! agree: dnsguard rejects the whole list on one bad address, so anything
//! this filter lets through and dnsguard then refuses costs us every good
//! upstream that was in the list alongside it.
//!
//! # Keeping the list current
//!
//! The resolved list goes stale the moment the network changes — a VPN
//! connect replaces the machine's resolvers in one step. This module also
//! owns the watcher that re-resolves on `NotifyIpInterfaceChange` events
//! (with a slow poll as the fallback) and pushes the result through
//! `UpstreamsHandle::set`, which keeps the previous list on error:
//! stale-but-working beats empty.
