//! Managed DNS blocklists: download, validate and install the lists the
//! web-protection proxy filters with.
//!
//! # Source and license
//!
//! The managed feed is the StevenBlack/hosts "unified hosts" list
//! (adware + malware), <https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts>, used under
//! the MIT License. The same list is vendored into the installer at
//! `runtime/rules/dns/stevenblack.hosts` (attribution and license text in
//! that file's header, and in NOTICE.md) as the offline seed; this module
//! keeps a separate, refreshed copy under `rules\dns\managed\`.
//!
//! # The failure contract
//!
//! Same rule the rest of `web_protection` runs on: under ANY uncertainty
//! degrade to "no filtering", never "no DNS". Concretely, for this module:
//!
//! - a failed download leaves the previous list in force;
//! - an empty, oversized, truncated or unparseable download is NEVER
//!   installed over a working one;
//! - this module only rewrites files under `rules\dns\managed\` — it
//!   cannot disable filtering, and it never touches the proxy or the NRPT
//!   rule.
//!
//! # Reload
//!
//! There is no live list reload: `service.rs` loads blocklists once, at
//! startup (`load_lists`), and exposes no reload signal. A freshly
//! installed list therefore takes effect at the next daemon start. The
//! [`RefreshReport`] returned here carries whether anything changed so a
//! future reload signal has something to key on.
