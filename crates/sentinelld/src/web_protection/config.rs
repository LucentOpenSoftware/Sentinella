//! `[web_protection]` configuration.
//!
//! POLARITY WARNING, read before changing anything here. Every other
//! config section in this crate has the property that turning a field OFF
//! is the harm — an attacker disabling realtime protection, say. This
//! section is the opposite: **turning it ON when the proxy cannot serve is
//! the harm, and turning it OFF is the emergency fix.** A DNS proxy the
//! machine has been pointed at, which is not answering, is a machine with
//! no name resolution at all. Design principle, from the review that
//! produced this module: *under any uncertainty the system must degrade to
//! "no filtering", never to "no DNS".*
//!
//! That is why `validate` here does NOT follow the crate's usual
//! clamp-and-warn convention. Resetting a malformed `listen` to a
//! plausible default (the pattern used by `update_mirror`,
//! `clamav_isolation`, `sandbox.mode` and friends) would leave the section
//! looking configured and let a later commit install an NRPT rule on the
//! strength of it. Invalid input FORCES `enabled = false`, following the
//! one existing precedent that does the same — developer mode without a
//! provisioned password.

// on_proxy_failure USED TO LIVE HERE, with values "remove_rule" and
// "fallback". It has been REMOVED, and the option must not come back in
// that shape.
//
// "fallback" was documented as "fail open: unfiltered DNS via the NRPT
// secondary". There is no NRPT secondary. The rule this daemon installs
// carries exactly ONE server - our own proxy (see rule.rs) - and an NRPT
// rule overrides the adapter's DNS configuration for every matching name.
// That is the entire purpose of NRPT. So leaving the rule in place when
// the proxy has died does not yield unfiltered DNS; it yields NO DNS.
//
// The polarity was therefore inverted: the option a careful operator picks
// BECAUSE it sounds like the safe one was the one that broke the machine.
// A single-server catch-all rule has no coherent "fail open" mode, so
// there is nothing to choose between and the key is gone.
//
// Making it real would mean writing the discovered system upstreams into
// GenericDNSServers as additional entries - at which cost the DNS Client
// would use them OPPORTUNISTICALLY while the proxy is healthy, which is a
// silent filtering bypass. That trade is worse than not having the option.
