//! Reading and removing Windows NRPT rules.
//!
//! # Why removal ships first, and alone
//!
//! An NRPT rule points the whole machine's DNS at a nominated resolver. It
//! lives in the registry and SURVIVES REBOOTS. The dangerous state is
//! therefore not "our proxy is broken" — it is "the rule is installed and
//! nothing is answering", which is a machine with no name resolution at
//! all, on every subsequent boot, for a user who cannot search for the fix
//! because search does not resolve.
//!
//! So ownership is inverted from the obvious design: the rule may exist
//! only while the daemon is proven healthy, and a boot-time reconciler
//! running OUT OF PROCESS is what enforces that. This crate is shared by
//! the reconciler (which removes) and later by the daemon (which installs).
//! Removal lands first so that at no point in the commit series can a rule
//! exist with nothing able to take it away.
//!
//! # Registry, not PowerShell
//!
//! `Remove-DnsClientNrptRule` is the documented interface and the wrong one
//! here. The reconciler runs at boot as SYSTEM, must finish in
//! milliseconds, and must work where PowerShell is absent (Server Core,
//! Nano) or restricted (ConstrainedLanguage). Spawning powershell.exe costs
//! module autoload and can block for seconds. Deleting the rule's own
//! subkey is a handful of syscalls with no external dependency, and at boot
//! it lands before the DNS Client has read the policy at all.
//!
//! # Identity is the GUID, never the name
//!
//! Rules are identified by the GUID subkey they live under. Matching on
//! DisplayName or Comment would be check-then-act on a string an
//! administrator or another product can also set, and the failure mode is
//! deleting somebody else's DNS policy.
//!
//! THE INVARIANT THAT MAKES GUID-ONLY IDENTITY SAFE: whatever creates a
//! rule must write its GUID to disk BEFORE creating it. A missing GUID file
//! then means the rule was never created — not that we have lost track of
//! one. The installing side (commit C) has to honour that ordering; this
//! crate's `record_guid` exists to make it the easy thing to do.
