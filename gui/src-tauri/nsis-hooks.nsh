  ; ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING, for the same reason it is in PREUNINSTALL.
  ;
  ; An UPGRADE does not run the old uninstaller: installer.nsi skips it in
  ; update mode, and the non-uninstall radio choice skips it interactively.
  ; So NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL — which holds the careful --remove ladder — is
  ; NOT executed on the upgrade path. This hook is the only thing that runs.
  ;
  ; It used to `taskkill /F` sentinelld.exe first. That destroys the only
  ; in-process path that removes the NRPT rule (WebProtection::stop), so
  ; every upgrade left a catch-all rule routing all DNS at a port whose
  ; listener had just been killed. For the length of the install the machine
  ; had NO DNS, and if the install then aborted it stayed that way until the
  ; next reboot, with the service already deleted.
  ;
  ; So: ask nicely first, and remove the rule explicitly before resorting to
  ; force.

  ; 1. Graceful stop. Lets the daemon run its own shutdown, which removes the
  ;    rule and is the only path that also stops the proxy cleanly.

  ;    install's binary — PREINSTALL runs before Tauri overwrites files, so
  ;    it is still on disk. Missing (fresh install, or an older version that
  ;    predates the reconciler) is fine: there is no rule to remove.
